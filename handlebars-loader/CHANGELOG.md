# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Helpers can now use ECMAScript 6 export syntax and have their default export used. Thank you @kt0.
- new `exclude` query option lets you prevent helpers from being resolved to
  modules in specified directories (such as `node_modules`). Thank you @ericmatthys.
